MS_001,VagueTarget,"While has target (net-zero by 2050) and baseline (2019), the word 'Aiming' is hedging language. Following decision tree: hedging language = automatic VagueTarget regardless of other elements",High,Yes

MS_036,QuantitativeTarget,"Specific target (1 gigaton CO2e), deadline (2050), scope (portfolio companies), baseline (from investment date). 'Seek to' is hedging BUT this describes the platform's goal, not MS's hedged commitment. Complex boundary case.",Medium,Yes
